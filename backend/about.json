    "bio": "Let me at your project! I've been an adept chemical engineer with professional operations experience in critical environments including nuclear power and data facilities, but I'm looking to change it up and move into programming. I'm currently succeeding in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Remote program, and I can't wait to jump into a role and gain experience. I love deep-dives, learning new areas of expertise, and leading teams to excellence. Looking to do hard work and have fun while doing it. Fast typer and spelling bee champ. Here to brighten up your team!"
